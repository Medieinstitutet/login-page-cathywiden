generic

[x] basic html/css OBS without input fields as those are dynamic content
[x] header Welcome!
[x] footer
[x] set up predefined user/pass combos
[x] include janne/test
[x] document all preset users in readme.md


fix three page layouts

[x] (1) default with user/pass input fields
[x] (2) logged in: welcome [user] message 
[x] logout option
[x] (3) registration page


dynamic content via js

[x] if not logged in, show login page
[x] if logged in, welcome [user] + logout option
[x] error message if wrong password entered
[x] logged in status saved in localStorage


new user registration

// [ ] separate registration and login. No auto log-in
[x] do not allow to register new user with existing username
[x] if username already exists, redirect to login page OR ask for new username
[x] e.g. janne6 is allowed to register
[x] error message if any field is left empty
[x] error message if passwords do not match
[?] new user's logged-in status saved in localStorage
[ ] new user should be persistent (added to JSON permanently) ? (Is this at all possible with LS?)
